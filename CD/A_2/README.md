Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects related to compiler design. Each project addresses fundamental concepts in parsing and tokenization in programming languages. The projects included are:

First and Follow
This program computes the First and Follow sets for a given context-free grammar. It helps in understanding how parsers determine the beginning of strings derivable from non-terminals and how to manage grammar rules.
Infix to Postfix
This program converts mathematical expressions from infix notation (the common way of writing expressions) to postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation). This is useful for simplifying the evaluation of expressions in compilers.
Operator Precedence Parser
This parser implements operator precedence parsing, which is a method used to parse expressions based on operator precedence levels. It can handle arithmetic expressions with various operators and their associativity rules.
Number of Tokens in C
This program counts the number of tokens in a given C program. It identifies keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators, providing insights into the structure of the code.
